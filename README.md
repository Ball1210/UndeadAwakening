Paragraph 1
  Alex(p1) is trapped in a situation in a destroyed city against zombies, created by a lab full of scientists experimenting on the dead which created an outbreak of zombies.  Zombies soon enough consume the whole world, in order to finally kill off all the zombies you must complete all the waves of zombies.

<p>
Paragraph 2
 While fighting the zombies you will have to pick up perks(medkits) and ammo to survive longer.  You are eliminating the zombies wave by wave. Player 1 gets controlled by via [W,A,S,D]. In wave 1 regular zombies slowly move towards you, as you try to kill the zombies you have to collect ammo and medkits at the same time to get ready for wave 2.  In wave 2 new zombies come at you faster and deal more damage towards you than the wave 1 zombies.  Level 2 is a first person point of view where you are killing multiple zombies.  But these zombies don't just take one shot to kill, they take instead two shots to kill.  This battle between Alex and the zombies will determine if the zombies go extinct or if the zombies will kill Alex and infect the world.
